The simplest way to list every country as a selectable dropdown ü§ò

## Features
- Display a select field with **every ISO 639-1 language**. _tl;dr: The two-letter code._
- Built-in **localization** in **132** languages.
- Supports all the native **Select Filament Field** [features](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/select).


## Getting Started

We have made things easy for you start. Here is the three steps your need to follow:

1. **Install the addon**  
```bash
composer require parfaitementweb/filament-country-field
```

2. **Add the Country field in your Filament Resource.**

```php
use Parfaitementweb\FilamentCountryField\Country;

Country::make('country')
```

3. **Enjoy.**

## Configuration

On top of all **Select Filament Field** [features](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/select) methods, you can use these three helpers:

- `exclude()` removes an item from the list.
- `add()` adds your own value to the list.
- `map()` changes one key to another, such as `GB` to `UK`.

```php
use Parfaitementweb\FilamentCountryField\Country;

Country::make('country')
->exclude(['NL'])
->add(['MA' =>'Mars'])
->map(['GB' => 'UK', 'GF' => 'FR'])

```

## Clearing the Cache

To ensure better performance and faster response times, the country list is stored in the cache for easy retrieval, leading to an overall snappier user experience.

To clear the cached country list, you can utilize the built-in artisan command provided by Laravel. The following command can be run in your terminal or command line interface:

```bash
php artisan countries-field:clear
```

## Conclusion

Caching is a crucial aspect of our application to improve performance. However, it is important to manage your cache and clear it when necessary to maintain the accuracy and freshness of the data presented to the users. Be sure to utilize the appropriate Laravel artisan commands to manage your application's cache effectively.

## Built-in translations
The country values are displayed according to the user's current locale settings, which are determined by the App::getLocale() value.

The field supports those **132 languages**:
